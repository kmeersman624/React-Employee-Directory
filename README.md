  ## Installation
  Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

  The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

  ## Usage
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
